					                <p class="item-intro text-muted"><u>Business Intelligence web application for the Renault Auto Branch investment plan</u></p>
									<p><i>UI/UX Designer at Renault Digital Finance Hub</i></p>
									<p>TASK: User Research, UX Design, UI Design<br>
										GOAL: Help analysts, managers and stakeholders build and consult investment forecasts
										according to business objectives by reducing processing time, automating procedures
										and therefore increasing their productivity.<br>
										TOOLS: Sketch, Invision
									</p>
									<p><u>OVERVIEW</u><br><strong>What is Invest?</strong></p>
									<p>A Business Intelligence web app that allows analysts, buyers, budgets owners and
										other employees responsible for investment plans, to build and consult financial
										forecasts in a more fast and productive routine, with a reduced processing time,
										automated procedures and the ability to share information through a more user
										friendly reporting interface.
									</p>
									<p><u>BACKGROUND: THE PROBLEM / PROBLEM STATEMENT</u><br><strong>The goal / desired outcome / the problem that it was trying to solve</strong></p>
									<p>Analysts and managers that work at the Renault investment plan are responsible for
										bulding forecasts, processing, calculating and analyzing large quantities of data. These
										are extremely time-consuming processes and the users have to work with complex
										Excel spreadsheet files, consisting of multiple worksheets featuring extended
										functionality via VBA scripts and VBA generated UI elements.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/excel_vba.png">
									<p>The goal was to design a real-time cloud app that automates steps that don’t need
										human intervention and allows users to focus more on detailed analysis and other
										procedures with major impact on performance, and less on processing data. Moreover,
										the general desired outcome would be simplifying the process of the investment plan
										and saving time by eliminating manual calculations and reducing human errors.
									</p>
									<p>The challenge was to offer a multidimensional reporting tool that addresses different
										concerns and that enables automated and standardized reporting, while also allowing
										users to build and run amortization simulations and computed forecast of the
										investment plan.
									</p>
									<p><u>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</u><br><strong>My Role</strong></p>
									<p>I was part of a cross-functional team of 12 members, including an Agile coach and a
										Scrum master that helped us adopt an Agile way of working. We worked in two-week
										sprints and attended all the Scrum ceremonies, which allowed us to collaborate,
										communicate and iterate more efficiently.
									</p>
									<p>I was the only Designer in my team and worked together with one Frontend Developer,
										one Business Analyst, one Product Owner, one Technical Team Lead, a few Backend
										Developers, one Architect, a Devops Engineer, a Scrum Master and an Agile Coach.
									</p>
									<p>During the project, my role was to conduct user interviews, collaborate in design
										iterations and paper sketching sessions with the product owner and business analyst,
										create wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes, build and handover the final design to
										the developers.
									</p>
									<p><u>PROCESS</u><br><strong>User Research, User Persona</strong></p>
									<p>The user research consisted of telephone interviews, in-person interviews and filling an
										online survey. In the first phase, to better understand the users’ goals and pain points
										in their everyday work activities, I had an online survey with 20 questions sent to
										different stakeholders, analysts and managers. To my surprise, people were more than
										reluctant to this survey and I actually had complaints from management regarding
										this questionnaire and why do I need to know certain job related things. They were
										clearly not used to being interviewed, as they probably weren't familiar with the concept
										of user	research.
									</p>
									<p>Secondly, I continued with 3 in-person interviews and 3 phone interviews, with a
										duration of 30-40 minutes each. The user interviews were run with users from
										Romania, France, Italy and Germany, all Renault employees, and were focused on
										understanding their workflow.
									</p> 
									<p>Based on the interviews, I categorized the users into three personas: the Investment
										Analyst, the Budget Owner and the Administrator.
									</p>
									<p>The primary persona for the first phase of the project, the MVP, was the Investment Analyst,
										so all the design decisions	were made with this persona in mind.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/user_personas.png">
									<p><strong>User Journey Map</strong></p>
									<p>Furthermore, in order to review the experience from the user’s perspective and
										observe how he interacts with the product, I created a journey map. The process
										through which the user goes in order to accomplish his goal was complex and
										required a sequence of events, so a journey map was the only way to have the scenario
										easy to visualize and create a shared vision for the team.
									</p>
									<p>Key Findings<p>
									<p>High Priority:</p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>Users would like to have a faster and more efficient way-of-working; a more
												structured way of entering information into the system and the ability to renew the
												reports on a day-to-day basis.
											</li>
											<li>Ability to view, analyze and compare projects in one application; automatic reporting.</li>
											<li>Enable them to focus on analysis.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>Medium Priority:</p> 
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>The ability to get the necessary data without having to reach other colleagues. Their
												daily responsibilities are demanding and they would like to be more independent.
											</li>
											<li>Users want more accurate information and to be able to take decisions fast; a better defined process.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>Low Priority:</p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>A more user-friendly and helpful platform.</li>
											<li>Allow some of their clients to check their reportings by themselves.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/user_journey_map.png">
									<p><u>DESIGN ITERATIONS</u><br><strong>Block Diagram, User flow</strong></p>
									<p>After better understanding the user’s needs and wants, I started building a block
										diagram, followed by a user flow. They proved very effective when communicating with
										the developers during the implementation phase, but also when evaluating individual
										screens and creating the UI design.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/block_diagram.png">
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/user_flow.png">
									<p><strong>Wireframe</strong></p>
									<p>In order to collect feedback as fast as possible, I started building the wireframes right
										from the research phase, when making adjustments to the initial concept represented
										a low risk. The tool I used to design the wireframes was Balsamiq.
									</p>
									<p>The low-fidelity prototypes were validated during meetings with the Business Analyst
										and the Product Owner. It was a collaborative and stimulating group work, resulting in
										more people getting involved in the process and having sessions where I was
										sketching in Balsamiq together with the Business Analyst, making notes and revisions.
									</p>
									<p>The focus for the MVP was on the New EPRI and MTP sections. New EPRI handled
										reports per budget owner (the user was able to view the status on all projects/reports)
										and the drill down functionality (the user was able to filter the content using specific
										criteria). MTP functioned like an excel file: the user was able to see project details and
										perform different actions: update project details (visibility of columns, freeze, use
										qualitative fields), create new models of reports, compare using graphs.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/wireframes.png">
									<p>It was a big challenge, mostly because the stakeholders had high expectations. They
										basically wanted to have a cake and eat it too. And as we all know, you can’t
										simultaneously retain your cake and eat it :). The cake was an all-in-one application
										with Excel’s complex structure and features, that whould also be user-friendly, fast to
										navigate, easy to understand and use.
									</p>
									<p>Simplifying it meant to focus on the key functionalities, but also stick to the business
										requirements and don’t get discouraged by the heavy-data tables, with complex
										formulas, tens of columns and sheets.
									</p>
									<p><strong>High-fidelity prototyping</strong></p>
									<p>After getting the final-design approval from stakeholders and when everybody in the
										team had a solid understanding of what they are going to build, I started designing the
										high-fidelity prototypes.
									</p>
									<p>For the UI design, one of my favorite phases during any project, I started by creating a
										moodboard in Xtensio, using colors, components, icons, fonts and images according to
										Renault Digital’s guidelines.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/moddboard.png">
									<p>Next, I started the hi-fi prototypes by using and adapting components from Renault
										Digital’s design system. I designed the UI in Sketch and I used the shared Sketch
										library for the design system components. The Sketch library consisted of custom
										made icons, a brand color scheme and UI components.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/hi_fi_new_epri.png">
									<p>To better show the interactivity of the prototypes, I uploaded the screen to Invision.
										That also facilitated a smooth design handoff, allowing the frontend developer to
										inspect and get the required information and specifications.
									</p>
									<p>During this phase, I worked closely with the frontend developer, clarifying any
										technical blocker, understanding the true capabilities and constraints of the platform. For
										example, having a “freeze column” functionality in a table was a very important business
										requirement that was almost scrapped due to some problems with the
										framework used by the engineering team, Angular. Moreover, having more than one
										fixed column headers was an unforeseen technical problem that took the developers
										longer than one sprint to solve.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/invest/hi_fi_mtp.png">
									<p><u>OUTCOME AND RESULTS</u><br><strong>The challenge / Lessons learned</strong></p>
									<p>Since this was the application’s MVP, it is important to highlight that the product
										continued to grow in an iterative process. I was assigned to other projects, but the
										remaining screens of the application and addressing the other user personas
										remained a top priority for future releases. The MVP was successful and plans for the
										first and second releases continued as scheduled.
									</p>
									<p>It was my first time designing a complex financial application with such an ambitious
										plan of changing the way-of-working for so many employees. It meant replacing Excel
										spreadsheet files, hours of manual calculations, reports and analysis, with a modern
										web application, so I was really excited about the outcome.
									</p>
									<p>An important lesson that I’ve learned was that even though the work may come from
										the product owner, it’s the individual developers who do it. The product owner that I
										worked with for this project trusted my design decisions and supported me all the way,
										but his time was limited. In order to get the design implemented like it was, pixel
										perfect, I had to get the frontend developer to work with me and not see me as an
										outsider. Building a relationship with developers is more important than people might think.
										Designers often feel frustrated that developers don’t implement their beautiful, pixel-
										perfect designs (if I had a nickel for every time I felt that way… ) and developers think
										we’re there to make their lives more difficult by giving them a pretty picture to copy
										with no regard for its technical complexity and deadline. So by talking to the frontend
										developer about my ideas, understanding what he had to do and letting him suggest
										things, a real collaboration, like it should always be, took place.
									</p>
									<p>I learned how to effectively justify my design and related design decisions during
										discussions and I also realized that open communication within the team motivates all
										the members and drives the entire project.
									</p>
									<p>In the end, I think it was all about managing expectations, weighing the business
										needs and the user needs, adapting what I wanted to be a perfect design (process) to
										what was both possible and practical.

							  		<h2 class="text-uppercase">World Of Tanks</h2>
							  		<p class="item-intro text-muted"><u>Design mockups for a new game feature (a seasonal event) for one of the most popular battle games on PC, World of Tanks.</u></p>
									<p><i>Self project, Design challenge</i></p>
									<p>TASK: Information Architecture, UX Design, UI Design, Visual Design<br>
										GOAL: Tracking the World of Tanks players’ progress in the seasonal event<br>
										TOOLS: Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop
									</p>
									<p><u>OVERVIEW</u><br><strong>What is World Of Tanks?</strong></p>
									<p>A team-based, massively multiplayer online (MMO) tank battle game developed by
										Wargaming. It’s built on a "freemium" business model, but players also have the option
										of paying a fee for premium vehicles and features.
									</p>
									<p><u>BACKGROUND: THE PROBLEM / PROBLEM STATEMENT</u><br><strong>The goal / desired outcome / the problem that it was trying to solve</strong></p>
									<p>The goal of this project was to create an engaging and motivating experience for
										World of Tanks users, that also tracks the players' progress during a special event.
										Moreover, I had to take the design requirements specified by the
										Creative Director and Game Designer into consideration:
										<ul>
											<li>the event is available for a singular limited time (3 weeks);</li>
											<li>players can participate in a new game mode developed for the event;</li>
											<li>by participating, they will complete quests separated into 7 tiers to obtain rewards;</li>
											<li>player must complete one tier before starting the next one;</li>
											<li>each tier offers two parallel quests: <strong>accumulative</strong> (100 miles traveled, 100 kills
												scored, 100000 points of damage done etc) and <strong>skill based</strong> (score the most kills in a match,
												win under 7 minutes etc);
											</li>
											<li>if a player achieves either the accumulative or the skill-based condition, they
												complete the current tier, are awarded a tier reward (primary and premium currency,
												consumables, vanity items etc) and progress to the next tier with harder quests and
												better rewards;
											</li>
											<li>by completing all the seven tier, players will be awarded one final reward (vehicle);</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p><u>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</u><br><strong>My Role</strong></p>
									<p>During this project, my role was to build the information architecture and the user
										flow, create the low-fidelity prototypes, the user interface and the visual design.
									</p>
									<p><u>PROCESS</u><br><strong>Research</strong></p>
									<p><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></p>
									<p>With research goals in mind, I gathered information about multiplayer video games
										and identified a baseline for what users expect.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/wot/competitive_analysis.png">
									<p>After analyzing screenshots and videos from different MMO battle games (World of
										Tanks, War Thunder, World of Warplanes etc) and familiarizing myself with the
										interface and basic functionality, I joined two representative and popular groups on
										Facebook: War Thunder Worldwide and World of Tanks International. As a designer,
										there is no other place you could get more valuable information about what users
										want, their frustrations and challenges, than a Facebook group with thousands of members.
										Here I could easily read through all the posts related to recent events and
										what players found frustrating, what they liked or disliked. Gamers also like doing live
										streams and posting videos with gameplays on YouTube, so that also contributed to
										my research.
									</p>
									<p>Being a World of Tanks player myself a couple of years back, I was also part of the War
										Thunder Worldwide group back then and knew that these groups would be a gold
										mine of valuable feedback from avid consumers. The interaction between players is
										awesome and I got the chance to read some real-time feedback from them.
									</p>
									<p>I also researched past WoT challenges and events (Halloween, Christmas game events)
										to learn about the general structure of a game mode. Building the information
										architecture for this event was challenging - I had to organize and structure the
										content so that the users, the WoT players, would easily adjust to the functionality and
										find everything they need effortlessly, while also gamifying the experience.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>the “fun factor” is the key to attracting new users. It’s a term used to describe the
												dynamics of the game, the overall look and feel and the satisfaction per shot;
											</li>
											<li>users are very specific when playing military games and care a lot about studying
												and researching all the different weapons, the variety of vehicles and aircraft in the
												game, how historically correct they are; some players only play with tanks, some with
												aircraft and some play with both.
											<br><br><p>[SIDE NOTE: for example, in War Thunder, there is a so-called "Battle Trophy" Award
												that you get when you earn a certain amount of points in a battle (arcade/realistic/
												simulator with any vehicle, tank or plane). It’s supposed to gamify the experience and
												further motivate the player. It works just like a wheel of fortune, but where you often win drive-
												tests with a tank, even though you only play with aircrafts. Many fans have complained about
												this on the forums and groups - did I mention that online games consumers are
												notorious vocal about their frustrations?]</p>
											</li>
											<li>the learning curve: while some users say that Arcade mode can sometimes be
												underwhelming although it’s much easier to play (Arcade mode in the game world
												can be translated to “pick-up-and-play mode” or “no-brainer mode”, playing in other
												game modes like Realistic or Simulator can have a steep learning curve and
												discourage a lot of users;
											</li>
											<li>community is important for online games like these and both World of Tanks and
												War Thunder have social systems in place where like-minded players can join, chat
												and form groups;
											</li>
											<li>modifications are integral parts of the games settings that affect the gameplay
												(appearance, sound, combat and hangar modifications) and an important feature for
												users; they like customizing, changing the game interface and adding new
												functionalities;
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p><strong>User flow</strong></p>
									<p>After better understanding the general structure of a game event and how
										gamification can engage and motivate the user in completing all the milestones
										(tiers), I started building a user flow.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/wot/user_flow.png">
									<p>
										<ol>
											<li>EVENT POPUP (appears as a popup when you enter the game - with 2-3 weeks prior to event start)</li>
											<li>SPLASH SCREEN (appears on the day the events start, first time the player enters the
												game). It's the interface at the start of the event and it contains info about the event
												and prizes. User can close it using the close button.
											</li>
											<li>NEW GARAGE SCREEN LAYOUT (example: Winter Challenge, Christmas or
												Halloween events). New environmental elements appear: special effects, new
												surroundings, new vehicles (example: the Leviathan).
											</li>
											<li>NEW ICON/FLAG/TAB on the Garage screen directing the user to the new game
												mode available.
											</li>
											<li>NEW GAME MODE SCREEN appears when clicking the icon (it contains a progress
												infographic of the 7 quests, conditions and rewards for each step). The player can click
												on it to see his progress.
											</li>
											<ul>
												<li>each quest must be completed before starting the new one and there are two ways of completing it;</li>
												<li>after completing a stage, the player wins the quest awards and proceeds to the next one;</li>
												<li>there is a grand prize at the end of all 7 quests;</li>
												<li>the user has 3 weeks to complete all stages.</li>
											</ul>
											<li>FINAL SCREEN appears when the user has completed all of the event tasks during
												the timeframe and is awarded the Grand Prize.
											</li>
											<li>REWARD POPUPS - When completing one quest after a battle, a popup appears
												above the DRAW/DEFEAT/VICTORY screen that informs the player he has completed a
												stage. A call-to-action buttons directs him to the NEW GAME MODE SCREEN to see his
												reward.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</p>
									<p><strong>Wireframe</strong></p>
									<p>Following the research stage, I went through all the gathered materials and I started the
										low-fidelity mockups, the wireframes.
									</p>
									<p>SPLASH SCREEN</p>
									<p>The first wireframe represents the interface at the start of the event:</p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>the upper part is the game's navigation: the menu that allows the user to go to
												different areas of the Garage;
											</li>
											<li>it contains the start and end date of the event, the name and a short description of
												the event, a "Learn more" link - it directs the user to a website where more info and help
												(if needed) are available;
											</li>
											<li>it contains a picture of the Grand Prize and the Quest bar separated into 7 tiers to
												track the player's progress.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/wot/splash_screen_wireframe.png">
									</p>
									<p>NEW GAME MODE SCREEN</p>
									<p>The second wireframe represents the interface for a player as the event is taking place:</p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>appears when clicking the event icon on the Garage screen;
												<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/wot/garage_wireframe.png">
											</li>
											<li>it contains the start and end date of the event, the name of the event and a "Learn more" link;</li>
											<li>it contains the Quest bar where the user can track his progress at any point (from the Garage screen);</li>
											<li>the user can see which missions are completed and which are not. The user can also
												see all missions and prizes when clicking the "See all" button;
												<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/wot/new_game_mode_screen.png">
											</li>
											<li>if the user completes a mission/tier after a battle, a popup appears next to the DRAW/
												DEFEAT/VICTORY screen that informs the player of it. A call-to-action button directs him to
												the NEW GAME MODE SCREEN to see his reward and next mission objectives.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>FINAL SCREEN</p>
									<p>The final wireframe represents the interface for a player that has completed all tasks:</p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>it contains a Congratulations message and the Grand Prize the player gets for
												completing the Quest bar in the event timeframe.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/wot/final_screen_wireframe.png">
									<p>I also created an interactive clickable prototype in order to better check the user’s
										interaction with the new product feature.
									</p>
									<p><strong>High-fidelity prototyping</strong></p>
									<p>After designing the low-fidelity prototypes, I started designing the high-fidelity
										interface for the start of the event, in-progress event and for completing the event. For
										some of the visual assets (illustrations, vehicle photos), I used materials that I found on
										the WoT website. For the rest, I had some fun and created a few, using a similar style to
										the existing ones, doing my best to maintain their brand identity.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/wot/hi_fi_prototypes.png">
									<p>I used Adobe XD for wireframing and prototyping, Photoshop and Illustrator for
										creating the visual assets.
									</p>
									<p><u>OUTCOME AND RESULTS</u><br><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
									<p>While working on this project I had the chance to experience the world of online video
										games, refresh my mindset and get a real feel of what it means to create a digital product
										having more than 10 million users.

					  				<h2 class="text-uppercase">NTSA Cloud App</h2>
					  				<p class="item-intro text-muted"><u>Enterprise identity and access management (IAM) product design: Network Traffic Security Analytics Cloud App</u></p>
									<p><i>Product Designer at Bitdefender</i></p>
									<p>TASK: UI Design, Visual Design<br>
										GOAL: Help IT department, system administrator to automate repetitive tasks<br>
										TOOLS: Sketch, Invision
									</p>
									<p><u>OVERVIEW</u><br><strong>What is NTSA Cloud App?</strong></p>
									<p>An Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform that provides the IT department
										with the right tool and technology for provisioning accounts and licenses through an
										efficient and productive cloud-based system.
									</p>
									<p><u>BACKGROUND: THE PROBLEM / PROBLEM STATEMENT</u><br><strong>The goal / desired outcome / the problem that it was trying to solve</strong></p>
									<p>The overaching goal of identity management is to grant access to enterprise assets to
										the right users, as needed, in a timely fashion. Identity and access management is a
										critical part of any enterprise security plan, especially for a company that provides
										cybersecurity services. It serves as a protection layer and safeguards against
										ransomware, phishing, malware attacks, compromised user credentials and access
										that can often serve as an open gate into an organization’s network.
									</p>
									<p>This NTSA cloud app also serves as a provisioning tool that gives a single point of
										maintenance to manage users access to NTSA (Network Traffic Security Analytics, a
										Bitdefender enterprise security product), that automates tasks suchs as creating,
										editing and deleting companies, users and licenses, as well as maintaining organized
										records of clients information such as company details, application credentials and
										license keys.
									</p>
									<p>The desired outcome was to offer an easy to manage cloud solution, a link between
										people and technology, and to bring all of the company data together. With all of this
										in mind, the cloud solution had to ease their day to day tasks, provide security,
										flexibility, automatic software updates and mobility.
									</p>
									<p><u>USERS AND AUDIENCE</u><br><strong>The Research</strong></p>
									<p>A qualitative research debrief was provided by our Customer Experience department,
										with its main objective being exploring and understanding customers from the mid-
										market business area. The user research consisted of 17 telephone interviews with a
										duration of 45-60 minutes each. The results of CX’s research discovered two user
										personas, young performers and mature performers. The research showed that the
										two user personas have both differences, but also many similarities. Most of them had
										a solid education in IT and job positions as follows: IT Manager, IT Technical Support,
										System Engineer, System Administrator, IT Analyst etc.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>
									<p>Some of the common frustrations were that they don’t have the chance to perform
										daily as system administrators, but rather have to solve menial tasks like lost
										passwords, recovering user accounts, system upgrades and other software issues. They
										also have to deal with downtime and patching.
									</p>
									<p><u>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</u><br><strong>My Role</strong></p>
									<p>During the project, my role was to undertake building a design system, visual design,
										branding assets and specifications, creating the high-fidelity prototypes and hand
										them over to development while also establishing a clear communication line with
										them for the support phase.
									</p>
									<p>For the first two months, I collaborated with another Designer that was in charge for
										the low-fidelity mockups and user flows. In addition, I worked alongside a Product
										Manager and a small team of software developers (half of the team worked remotely).
									</p>
									<p><u>PROCESS</u><br><strong>The Process</strong></p>
									<p>Taking into consideration that the allocated time for the project was shortened after a
										re-prioritization of the roadmap, it was a big challenge to follow a step-by-step design
										workflow. While the other designer was creating the low-fidelity wireframes, I started
										building the visual components for the design system.
									</p>
									<p>I attended weekly sync meetings and demos, where we discussed and brainstormed
										with the whole team, iterating and getting feedback from the Product Manager and
										the development team. When a wireframe for a screen was approved, I would already
										start working at the high-fidelity prototype. Engineers were involved in the design
										process early on, in order to get feedback during the ideation phase. Everytime a
										developer had questions regarding a certain component or screen, we would sit
										together and talk about technical capabilities and other issues. We were constantly
										going back and forth on Slack to discuss implementation.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/ntsa_cloud/login_register_screens.png">
									<p>The whole process was based on a waterfall model and meant that I had to continuously
										deliver final prototypes, while also sending time estimates for the newly approved
										screens, delivering full assets and specifications for finished mockups to the
										development team and also collaborating with the QA testers.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Evolution of the NTSA cloud app</strong></p>
									<p>Creating the NTSA cloud app user interface involved multiple iterations mostly due to
										technical limitations of the framework and library used by the engineering team.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/ntsa_cloud/add_company_companies_company_details.png">
									<p>After the wireframes were approved, I started bulding the high-fidelity prototypes in
										Sketch and uploading them to Invision for a fast handover to the development team.
										Invision is a simple tool that allows developers to pull all the assets and specs for the
										design and it was actually the first time for the developers to use such a tool. I was
										excited to find out that they liked it and they found it very useful in getting what they
										needed with little to no friction.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/ntsa_cloud/license_users.png">
									<p>Jira was used to track the progress of the stories. Slack was used for online meetings
										(part of the team was working remotely), Sketch (for designing the UI and the design system),
										Invision (used for prototyping and handover finalized design, resources and assets for
										development).
									</p>
									<p><u>DESIGN EXPLORATION</u><br><strong>The Design System</strong></p>
									<p>In order to help the development scale the product and future features, I also
										established a design system. I was nervous at first and didn’t think I would find the
										time to work on so many tasks simultaneously: building new screens from approved
										wireframes at the beginning of the sprint, making adjustments to the screens that
										were in development, support and review the frontend team’s process and build a
										design system.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/ntsa_cloud/sketch_library.png">
									<p>The system included a style guide, a component library and more. I used Atomic
										Design for building the design system, a methodology that divides components into 5
										levels: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages. It’s important to add that I
										was inspired by Material design system when creating the components and that
										Sketch was used to create the symbol library.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/ntsa_cloud/design_system.png">
									<p><strong>Iconography</strong></p>
									<p>For the iconography part, I used icons from the Material Design Icon Library, while also
										designing a few customized ones too. The development team needed a custom made icon
										font, so I uploaded them to an Icomoon font library.
									</p>
									<p>I decided to use some simple and clean typefaces, Montserrat and Roboto (Montserrat
										for body copy, buttons and headlines and Roboto for infographics, charts and
										numerical indicators).
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/ntsa_cloud/icons.png">
									<p><strong>Color Scheme - Dark UI</strong></p>
									<p>After analyzing the competitors' color scheme, I discussed the idea of having a dark UI
										with the Product Manager and the team and they were thrilled. The colors are designed
										to be clear and accessible with a primary color selected to represent the brand.
										Sometimes, NTSA needs to show multiple infographics on a single screen so, in order
										to present readable data, I have adopted an extended color theme with one primary
										color and six additional ones, colors for background, surfaces, errors, typography and
										iconography.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/ntsa_cloud/color_scheme.png">
									<p><strong>Illustrations for empty states</strong></p>
									<p>Making illustrations for the empty state pages was so much fun. If you’re wondering
										why I used a space theme, well, I would say it’s a branding idea that I came up for
										Bitdefender’s Gravity Zone product. I’m proud to say that it slowly became a leitmotif
										for all illustrations used for the enterprise products.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/ntsa_cloud/illustrations.png">
									<p><u>OUTCOME AND RESULTS</u><br><strong>The challenge / Lessons learned</strong></p>
									<p>The target market was enterprise, so this meant working with valuable data. Moreover,
										when designing for enterprise and business applications, you rarely have the chance to
										use your own products, so you have to be an excellent researcher and designer in order
										compensate for not working as a real user with the application you’re building.
									</p>
									<p>It wasn’t enough to know how to design a good web application, I also had to understand
										security IT	standards and adhere to industry guidelines, but also focus my innovation on
										certain parts, without burying essential data in unneccessary interactions. But that’s only
										one of the challenges every designer encounters when creating enterprise tools.
									</p>
									<p>Moreover, the project was timeboxed, with a very tight deadline and a busy backlog,
										which meant that both engineering and design teams had to work under pressure.
										Being the sole designer in the team for the most part of the project meant that I had
										to work in the same sprint as the engineering team, alongside them. Delivering fast was
										essential so that developers could start implementing the mockups as soon as possible. There
										were times when designs tasks blocked development stories and didn’t allow the
										designers to focus on their tasks without the pressure of developer requiring design.
									</p>
									<p>This project's biggest challenge was to deliver the MVP on time, while also juggling
										with multiple tasks in the backlog. Working with at least one sprint before the
										engineering team wasn’t an option, so we had to make it work even though we didn’t
										have too much time.
									</p>
									<p>The MVP release was successful and the product launched as planned, but a short
										while after this had happened, the project was discontinued. Unfortunately, that meant
										we couldn’t measure the impact of the product, evaluate results from the planned
										beta testing and get testimonials from customers, although the feedback from our
										internal teams was good. However, this project provided me with a great opportunity
										to expand my knowledge.

					  				<h2 class="text-uppercase">Analytics Dashboard</h2>
					  				<p class="item-intro text-muted"><u>Menu and dashboard revamp for a business security product: NTSA (Network Traffic Security Analytics)</u></p>
									<p><i>Product Designer at Bitdefender</i></p>
									<p>TASK: UI Design<br>
										GOAL: Redesign the dashboard to help system administrators and security analysts<br>
										have an improved experience and overview<br>
										TOOLS: Sketch, Invision
									</p>
									<p><u>OVERVIEW</u><br><strong>What is NTSA?</strong></p>
									<p>NTSA is a business security solution that analyzes network traffic and detects threats,
										by using machine learning and behavior analytics.
									</p>
									<p><u>BACKGROUND: THE PROBLEM / PROBLEM STATEMENT</u><br><strong>Problem</strong></p>
									<p>The previous dashboard had an obsolete interface design and needed a modern visual
										style, a more user friendly experience and an improved navigation menu.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/analytics_dashboard/old_dashboard_and_menu.png">
									<p><u>RESEARCH</u></p>
									<p>I started the process by understanding the product and the context, what a dashboard
										may look like and how important data visualization is when it comes to improving the
										readability of the widgets.
									</p>
									<p>I knew that a good dashboard had to provide an overview of the current status of
										performance indicators while allowing the users to decide what areas they would like
										to focus on.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Key takeways</strong></p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>the ultimate goal of the dashboard was to increase productivity;</li>
											<li>the navigation menu had to be simplified by merging a few items;</li>
											<li>use a more structured layout for widgets, show useful information, but don’t
												overload it;
											</li>
											<li>all charts had to be consistent: use the same layout and spacing, have legends in the
												same position, same measurement systems, colors and fonts;
											</li>
											<li>establish a clean hierarchy - prioritizing data by importance was a must. The most
												important data should be represented on top and occupy the largest area;
											</li>
											<li>the user should be able to interact with the indicators and charts by hovering,
												clicking on the legend and drilling down from shown data;
											</li>
											<li>using enough white space was essential</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p><u>PROCESS</u></p>
									<p>Although I handled only the UI part of this project, I worked closely with a UX designer
										and was excited to deep dive into the dashboard design principles and best practices.
									</p>
									<p>I also worked together with a dedicated product owner and a small development
										team. The UX designer created the low-fidelity sketches in Axure. After the wireframes
										were validated with the product owner, I started working at the interface in Sketch. We
										also had weekly meetings with the team were we discussed the progress of the MVP
										and a few workshops with the sales engineers.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/analytics_dashboard/first_draft_of_the_dashboard.png">
									<p>When designing dashboards, asking for feedback is essential, so having those
										workshops helped a lot in improving the layout and the functionality. For example,
										there were a few sales engineers that found the dashboard was overcrowded with data and
										widgets.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/analytics_dashboard/v2_of_the_dashboard_light_theme.png">
									<p>As a result, we simplified the layout and focused more on the key indicators
										that they found useful. Following that, after more design iterations and feedback, we
										changed the dark theme that we started with to a light theme.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/analytics_dashboard/light_theme.png">
									<p>The handover was a collaborative process, having to constantly sync with the two full-
										stack developers that implemented the dashboard and the menu. Even though the mockups were
										uploaded to Invision and developers had access to all the assets and
										development specifications, due to the complexity of the dashboard, they needed
										reviews and support.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/analytics_dashboard/no_data_widgets.png">
									<p><u>CHALLENGES</u></p>
									<p>The biggest challenge was to identify the purpose of the visualization and choose the
										appropiate chart type. I used a mix of simple charts (bar charts, stacked bar charts,
										meter charts, sparkline charts) and complex charts. The simple charts offered a way to
										visualize the data in an easy and intuitive way that told a story. At the same time, the
										complex charts represented a more powerful way of displaying complex data sets,
										although less intuitive than basic charts (sankey/alluvial charts). Pie charts were
										completely removed - users find them difficult to compare when the pie slices are too
										thin / so thin to even display.
									</p>
									<p>There were a couple of explorations regarding the sankey chart - we received some
										interesting feeback about the functionality of making it full screen, so the user could
										better view the nodes and connections.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/analytics_dashboard/different_charts.png">
									<p>We worked in a waterfall way of working and that was a challenge by itself: there were
										no sprints and the development team needed mockups and quick adjustments as
										soon as we started the project. I often felt frustrated and pushed to deliver fast, but I
										eventually adapted.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/analytics_dashboard/different_components.png">
									<p>There were some some technical constraints along the way when choosing the chart
										library for the widgets, but eventually we decided to go with Fusion Charts. It was both
										customizable and aesthetically pleasing.
									</p>
									<p>Fusion Charts was also the starting point for creating the color palette for the data
										visualization. I used a few non-saturated colors in order to keep the consistency and
										users wouldn’t feel overwhelmed.

									<p><u>OUTCOME AND RESULTS</u><br><strong>Lessons learned</strong></p>
									<p>Even though this was my second dashboard project that I was working on, I was
										nervous at first. Compared to the previous version of the dashboard, the new
										designed dashboard was effective, had a modern look, was balanced and user friendly. The
										feedback we got from our internal teams was great, but, unfortunately, the project was
										eventually discontinued (it was later merged with another product).

									<p><i>Self project, Design challenge</i></p>
									<p>TASK: Wireframes, UI Design, Visual Design<br>
										GOAL: Create a mobile web application for game players<br>
										TOOLS: Balsamiq, Adobe Photoshop, Invision
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/video_games_store/intro.png">
									<p><u>BACKGROUND</u><br><strong>The goal</strong></p>
									<p>The goal of this project was to create a mobile web application that highlights new
										launched games, gives the user the possibility to browse games by category, checks
										in-progress, paused and past downloads and has access to his/her profile. The requirements
										included designing the wireframes for a home screen, a product screen, a browse and
										a download screen, but also the high-fidelity mockups for two of the screens.
									</p>
									<p>Although this was a speculative project, it also was a design challenge that I was
										excited to accept. I always wanted to create digital products for the game industry.
										They reach millions of consumers and, hopefully, make their life a lot more easier.
									</p>
									<p><u>PROCESS</u><br><strong>Research</strong></p>
									<p>I started my research by quickly building a moodboard. Collecting different screens for
										mobile and desktop video store applications was more than enough to sketch my first
										draft of the requiered deliverables. I was already familiarized with the video game
										world, the functionalities of an online store, the general look and feel.

						  			<h2 class="text-uppercase">Empty States</h2>
						  			<p class="item-intro text-muted"><u>Empty States for GravityZone security platform</u></p>
									<p><i>Product Designer at Bitdefender</i></p>
									<p>TASK: UX Design, UI Design, Visual Design<br>
										GOAL: Ease how users interact with empty pages within the platform, by
										communicating and providing guidance through text and images<br>
										TOOLS: Axure, Adobe Illustrator
									</p>
									<p><u>OVERVIEW</u><br><strong>What is GravityZone?</strong></p>
									<p>Bitdefender GravityZone is an enterprise-grade security platform, a next generation
										antivirus solution for businesses.
									</p>
									<p><u>PROBLEM</u></p>
									<p>As designers, we are constantly looking for opportunities to create meaningful
										experiences and add more value to the business. One such opportunity is the “empty
										state” which refers to the screens where data is missing. When I started working at
										Bitdefender, I realized that lack of empty states in such a complex product was a real
										issue.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/empty_states/gz_empty_states.png">
									<p>Some of these screens are nearly blank and don’t inform or instruct the user about
										how to proceed in order to go on a certain path. This can only leave users
										frustrated and lost. Moreover, the lack of information compels the user to spend extra
										time and effort figuring out their next step.
									</p>
									<p><u>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</u><br><strong>My Role</strong></p>
									<p>I was the only designer working at this feature and worked together with a technical
										writer for the UI copy. I was responsible for the UX and UI design, but also the
										illustrations.
									</p>
									<p><u>RESEARCH</u></p>
									<p>I started the research by doing a few quick moodboards in Axure. I also collected what I
										could find on empty states UI copy.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/empty_states/moodboard_images_ui_copy.png">
									<p>After spending some time analyzing the platform, I categorised the empty state
										opportunities into four types, based on what I thought I would be needing for the task
										at hand: first use, error, no results and loading.
									</p>
									<p>The result of my analysis was more than unexpected: tens of empty pages with not so much
										as a text guiding the user. But that was great news, it was going to be a more
										challenging task than before.
									</p>
									<p><u>FINDINGS</u></p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>empty states should be useful, helpful and informative, but also give the user
												additional direction or actions to take;
											</li>
											<li>empty states can occur in multiple areas of the platform, including dashoards, data
												tables, full pages and side panels. For the present task, I handled scenarios of empty
												states in data tables and full pages only;
											</li>
											<li>good opportunity for brand building and also personalizing the experience by
												adding a playful and fun sense;
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p><u>DESIGN EXPLORATION</u></p>
									<p>Creating the empty states involved multiple iterations and concept explorations.</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/empty_states/evolution_of_the_empty_states.png">
									<p>Most enterprise security solutions are overly plain and focus more on the functionality.
										Because I was given the opportunity to be very imaginative, I wanted to design a more
										positive and playful experience.
									</p>
									<p>I came up with a branding metaphor - the Universe, and successfully used it to design
										the illustrations. I’m proud to say that the space theme slowly became a leitmotif for all
										illustrations used for the enterprise products.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/empty_states/color_palettes_and_final_illustrations.png">
									<p><strong>Empty state 1: First use</strong></p>
									<p>Direct action is required by the user to get started, such as creating a company. Similar
										to the “No results” empty state, this one engages the user and provides guidance through the
										creation process, encouraging action.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/empty_states/empty_state_1_first_use.png">
									<p><strong>Empty state 2: Error</strong></p>
									<p>There is no data to show due to an external reason, like a lost internet connection. This
										scenario is the one that can cause the most frustration for users.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/empty_states/empty_state_2_error.png">
									<p><strong>Empty state 3: No results</strong></p>
									<p>This empty state occurs as a result of a user action and has to explain the reason for
										showing the message and provide steps to guide the user.
									</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/empty_states/empty_state_3_no_results.png">
									<p>Although it’s recommended that an empty state for a table replace the whole table
										(in order to avoid having a screen reader read the entire table before getting to the
										message that there is no content in the table, according to Jakob Nielsen), I decided to
										go with a different approach.
									</p>
									<p>The data tables that occur in the platform are heavy-duty and complex, with many
										filtering options available. Having the user customize the filters for a few minutes,
										applying the changes and not seeing any results, is a viable user case. In this case, the
										"Clear filters" button wasn’t enough for a good design solution. I decided to keep the
										filters visible, so that the user can modify them after having read the “no results found”
										message.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Empty state 4: Loading</strong></p>
									<p>Skeleton screen, when used to indicate that a screen is loading, are perceived as being
										shorter in duration when compared to a blank screen or a spinner. Using slow motion
										(like a wave, from left to right) also improves the overall waiting experience.</p>
									<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/portfolio_items/empty_states/empty_state_4_loading.png">
									<p><u>OUTCOME AND RESULTS</u><br><strong>The challenge / Lessons learned</strong></p>
									<p>What I learned from this project was that the benefits of including empty states in any
										product are understated, as they enhance the user experience and help create a more
										cohesive product.
									</p>
									<p>This was a challenging task that allowed me to combine both the visual with the
										analytical part of creating a feature for a product.
